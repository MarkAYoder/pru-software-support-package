Subject: [PATCH 13/13] arm: dts: am335x-boneblack.dts: Add labels to the hdmi
 and sound nodes

To allow device tree include files to disable the hdmi and sound nodes,
labels must be added.

Using the labels, these nodes can be disabled from device tree include
files which can alleviate pin mux conflicts with some capes. Including
the PRU cape which uses the am335x-boneblack-prucape.dtsi file.
